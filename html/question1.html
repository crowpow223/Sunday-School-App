					<span class="name">Jay:</span> Discouragement is curable. Whenever I get discouraged, I head straight to Nehemiah. This great leader of ancient Israel understood there were four reasons for discouragement.<span class="reply">Reply</span>

				<div class="single_awnser sub1">
					<span class="name">John:</span> You simply get tired as the laborers did in Nehemiah 4:10. We’re human beings, and we wear out. You cannot burn the candle at both ends. So if you’re discouraged, it may be you don’t have to change anything. You just need a vacation! Sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do is go to bed.<span class="reply">Reply</span>

				<div class="single_awnser sub2">
					<span class="name">Jay:</span> Nehemiah says there was rubble all around, so much that it was getting in the way of rebuilding the wall. Do you have rubble in your life? Have you noticed that anytime you start doing something new, the trash starts piling up?<span class="reply">Reply</span>

					<span class="name">Joe:</span> Nehemiah says there was rubble all around, so much that it was getting in the way of rebuilding the wall. Do you have rubble in your life? Have you noticed that anytime you start doing something new, the trash starts piling up?<span class="reply">Reply</span>

				<div class="single_awnser sub3">
					<span class="name">Jay:</span> If you don’t clean it out periodically, it’s going to stop your progress. You can’t avoid it, so you need to learn to recognize it and dispose of it quickly so you don’t lose focus on your original intention.<span class="reply">Reply</span>
				</div>
				<div class="single_awnser sub1">
					<span class="name">Joe:</span> But you know what I do when I don’t reach a goal on time? I just set a new goal. I don’t give up. Everybody fails. Everybody does foolish things. So the issue is not that you failed; it’s how you respond to your failure.<span class="reply">Reply</span>
				</div>
				<div class="single_awnser sub2">
					<span class="name">Joe:</span> Do you give in to self-pity? Do you start blaming other people? Do you start complaining that it’s impossible? Or, do you refocus on God’s intentions and start moving again?<span class="reply">Reply</span>
				</div>
				<div class="single_awnser sub3">
					<span class="name">Jay:</span> Nehemiah 4 suggests the people most affected by fear are those who hang around negative people. If you’re going to control the negative thoughts in your life, you’ve got to get away from negative people as much as you can.<span class="reply">Reply</span>
				</div>
				<div class="single_awnser sub3">
					<span class="name">John:</span> Maybe you’re discouraged because of fear. You’re dealing with fears like, “I can’t handle this. It’s too much responsibility.” Maybe it’s the fear that you don’t deserve it or the fear of criticism. Fear will destroy your life if you let it. But you can choose to resist the discouragement. Say, “God, help me get my eyes off the problem and the circumstance and keep my eyes on you.” <span class="reply">Reply</span>
